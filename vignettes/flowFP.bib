        abstract = "BACKGROUND: The implementation of flow cytometry in many experimental settings can be limited by the extensive amount of sample handling and preparation required for analysis. We describe a system that automatically performs sample handling and flow cytometric analysis, thus allowing one to construct detailed pictures of changes in cell population distributions as a function of time. METHODS: Cell samples from bioreactors were loaded into a microchamber designed to perform all sample preparation steps including washing, fixation, staining, and dilution. The sample was then transported into a sample loop of known volume from which it was injected into the flow cell for determination of cell counts and measurement of scattering and fluorescence parameters. The apparatus was fully automated and controlled with a personal computer equipped with a data acquisition card. An inexpensive mechanism that continuously replenished the sheath fluid was implemented to ensure continuous and uninterrupted operation of the flow cytometer for several days. The device was interfaced with a FACSCalibur equipped with CellQuest software for data acquisition and analysis. RESULTS: The set-up was tested with batch cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP). On-line cell counts showed close agreement with off-line measurements throughout the exponential growth of a yeast culture. The time course of light scattering, GFP fluorescence, and viability distributions provided a detailed description of changes occurring in growing cell cultures based on sampling approximately every 15 min for more than 40 consecutive hours. Therefore, the device could be used to obtain descriptions of the dynamic behavior of cell populations with no user intervention required for several days. CONCLUSIONS: The system significantly expanded the utility of flow cytometry by eliminating cumbersome and time-consuming steps that make the application of flow cytometry impractical in certain situations. It is anticipated that the described set-up will find utility in biotechnology applications such as monitoring of cell cultures, screening of biologically active compounds, and in functional genomics efforts for phenotypic characterizations of cells.",

        abstract = "Acute leukemia, defined as a genetic disease, is the most common cancer in children representing about one half of all cancers among persons younger than 15 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each represents a heterogeneous complex of disorders, with genetic abnormalities presenting in more than 80% of ALLs and more than 90% of AMLs. The diagnostic gold standard and classification of leukaemia involves various methods including morphology, cytochemistry, cytogenetics and molecular genetics, immunophenotyping, and molecular biology. These diagnostic methods are a prerequisite for individual treatment strategies and for the evaluation of treatment response especially considering that many distinct types of acute leukemia are known to carry predictable prognoses and warrant specific therapy. The quantification of gene expression is essential in determination of tailored therapeutic decisions. Microarray technology offers the possibility of quantifying thousands of genes in a single analysis, thus potentially becoming an essential tool for molecular classification to be used in routine leukaemia diagnostics. MLL+ leukaemia is a perfect example as to the exact correspondence between gene expression and protein expression evaluated by flow cytometry. Applying computational analysis to flow cytometry results, it is possible to distinguish the MLL+ acute leukemia from MLL- acute leukemia using as the top ranked antigen some top ranked genes described in the Microarray evaluation. Key markers discriminating different leukemia phenotypes can be identified by univariate hypothesis testing from a data set of immunophenotypic markers described by two variables, one reflecting the intensity of expression (MESF) and the other the pattern of distribution (CV). A current multi center study called Microarray Innovations in Leukemia (MILE Study) uses higher density gene chips providing nearly complete coverage of the human genome. The study which has analyzed thus far 1837 retrospective cases shows that each important leukemia subtype has a specific genetic fingerprint, meaning that different combinations of genes whose expression is linked to each subtype can be identified allowing for patient tailored therapy. Moreover, the study has achieved 97% diagnostic accuracy on samples from tested patients. Statistical analysis has shown a high concordance level between standard diagnostic procedures and those of the microarray technology--globally around 95.6%. Additionally it is possible to correctly classify some subgroups incorrectly identified using gold standard methods. Thus, from a technical viewpoint, gene expression profiling in tandem with flow cytometry should be a viable alternative to standard diagnostic approaches. Whether gene expression profiling will become a practical diagnostic alternative remains to be seen.",

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses - the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.",

        abstract = "Comparison of fluorescence distributions is a fundamental part of the analysis of flow cytometric data. This approach is applied to detect differences between control and test sample and thus analyze a biological response. Comparison of standard test samples over time provides an estimate of instrument stability for quality control. However, application of statistical methods of distribution comparison in flow cytometry is difficult owing to instrument noise and the complex shape of intensity distributions. We applied quadratic form (QF) as a mathematical metric for comparison of flow cytometry histograms. QF operates on histograms as vectors and calculates the total distance in an interbin manner using a matrix of distances between single histogram bins. Euclidean interbin distance and histograms normalized to unity were used. Critical values corresponding to 95% significance level were calculated using Monte-Carlo simulation and single-maximum Gaussian distributions populated with several numbers of events. The QF statistic was then validated for non-Gaussian single-maximum distributions and multiple-maxima distributions. We determined that the critical values for Gaussian distributions depended on standard deviations and number of events in the compared histograms. A simple empirical function was constructed to characterize this dependence. Furthermore, it was verified that critical values (corresponding to 95% significance) for non-Gaussian histograms were similar to values for the Gaussian histograms characterized by the same standard deviation. We applied the QF statistic to estimate the differences between histograms of DNA content (ploidy) in cells of old and young leaf tissue of Brassica campestris. Furthermore, we quantified differences in fluorescence intensity in immunostaining of human lymphocytes. Quadratic form (QF) provides a true (mathematical) metric for estimation of distance between flow cytometry histograms of arbitrary shape. QF can be applied as a statistical test for estimation of significance of the distance measure. The respective critical values depend only on the number of events and standard deviations of compared histograms and are not affected by distribution shape. Therefore, applications of QF do not require assumptions concerning distribution shape and can be easily implemented in practice. This notion was confirmed using empirical distributions of DNA content in plant tissue and distributions of immunofluorescence in human cells.",

These data are reduced during analysis using a manual or semiautomated process of gating. Despite the need to gate data for traditional analyses, it is well recognized that analyst-to-analyst variability can impact the dataset. Moreover, cells of interest can be inadvertently excluded from the gate, and relationships between collected variables may go unappreciated because they were not included in the original analysis plan. A multivariate non-gating technique was developed and implemented that accomplished the same goal as traditional gating while eliminating many weaknesses. The procedure was validated against traditional gating for analysis of circulating B cells in normal donors (n = 20) and persons with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (n = 42). The method recapitulated relationships in the dataset while providing for an automated and objective assessment of the data. Flow cytometry analyses are amenable to automated analytical techniques that are not predicated on discrete operator-generated gates. Such alternative approaches can remove subjectivity in data analysis, improve efficiency and may ultimately enable construction of large bioinformatics data systems for more sophisticated approaches to hypothesis testing.",

This technique uses the combination of CD45 intensity and right-angle light scatter (RALS) to distinguish leukemic cells from normal lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and nucleated red blood cells. On this display, leukemic cells occupy a unique blast region characterized by intermediate CD45 density and low RALS, which, in normal marrows, contains less than 5% of the total cells. This approach was applied to 39 cases of acute leukemia and 8 cases of myelodysplasia or myeloproliferative disorders. The estimate of blasts by flow cytometric analysis was correlated highly with morphologic leukemic cell counts over a wide range. Moreover, the pattern seen on the CD45-RALS display was different for different French-American-British subtypes of leukemia, suggesting that this pattern might be useful for categorization. When CD45-peridin chlorophyll alpha protein was combined with other pairs of fluorescein isothiocyanate- and phycoerythrin-conjugated reagents, it was possible to set an analysis window on the leukemic blasts and display dual-parameter (ie, green vs. red fluorescence) data regarding expression of two additional markers on the leukemic population. This gating strategy was superior to traditional forward-angle versus RALS displays in that it did a better job of isolating the leukemic cells analytically.",

The configuration of cells as represented by multiple markers simultaneously can be modeled arbitrarily well as a mixture of Gaussian distributions in the dimension of the number of markers. Cellular subtypes may be related to one or multiple components of such mixtures, and fitted mixture models can be evaluated in the full set of markers as an alternative, or adjunct, to traditional subjective gating methods that rely on choosing one or two dimensions. Four color flow data from human blood cells labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-CD3, PE-conjugated anti-CD8, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD4, and APC-conjugated anti-CD19 Abs was acquired on a FACSCalibur. Cells from four murine cell lines, JAWS II, RAW 264.7, CTLL-2, and A20, were also stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD11c, PE-conjugated anti-CD11b, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD8a, and PE-Cy7-conjugated-CD45R/B220 Abs, respectively, and single color flow data were collected on an LSRII. The data were fitted with a mixture of multivariate Gaussians using standard Bayesian statistical approaches and Markov chain Monte Carlo computations. Statistical mixture models were able to identify and purify major cell subsets in human peripheral blood, using an automated process that can be generalized to an arbitrary number of markers. Validation against both traditional expert gating and synthetic mixtures of murine cell lines with known mixing proportions was also performed. This article describes the studies of statistical mixture modeling of flow cytometric data, and demonstrates their utility in examples with four-color flow data from human peripheral blood samples and synthetic mixtures of murine cell lines.",

        abstract = "Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, HHV-3) is the etiological cause of chickenpox and, upon reactivation from latency, zoster. Currently, vaccines are available to prevent both diseases effectively. A critical requirement to manufacturing of safe and potent vaccines is the measurement of the biological activity to ensure proper dosing and efficacy, while minimizing potentially harmful secondary effects induced by immunization. In the case of live virus-containing vaccines, such as VZV-containing vaccines, biological activity is determined using an infectivity assay in a susceptible cellular host in vitro. Infectivity measurements generally rely on the enumeration of plaques by visual inspection of an infected cell monolayer. These plaque assays are generally very tedious, labor-intensive, have modest throughput and high associated variability. In this study, we have developed a flow cytometry assay to measure the infectivity of the attenuated vaccine strain (Oka/Merck) of VZV in MRC-5 cells with improved throughput. The assay is performed in 96-well tissue culture microtiter plates and is based on the detection and quantification of infected cells expressing VZV glycoproteins on their surface. Multiple assay parameters have been investigated, including specificity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), range of linear response, signal to noise ratio and precision. This novel assay appears to be in good concordance with the classical plaque assay results and therefore provides a viable, higher throughput alternative to the plaque assay.",

METHODS: Data came from blood specimens donated by 62 donors (50 HIV-positive) assayed over 2 years (November, 1996-October, 1998) by 35 laboratories in the NIAID DAIDS Flow Cytometry QA Program. RESULTS: Non-CD45 laboratories were significantly more likely to be classified as having unacceptable inter-laboratory results (far from the group median) than CD45 laboratories (5.6% vs 1.5%, P = 0.005 for CD3(+)4(+)%; 10.4% vs 5.0%, P = 0.007 for CD3(+)8(+)%). The intra-laboratory range of results on blinded replicates was significantly more likely to be deemed unacceptable (range >4%) in non-CD45 laboratories than in CD45 laboratories for CD3(+)8(+)% (14. 5% vs 3.5%, P = 0.002) but not for CD3(+)4(+)% (2.6% vs 1.5%, P = 0. 62). These differences in favor of CD45 gating were observed even though the non-CD45 laboratories had been doing three-color flow cytometry in the QA program significantly longer (P = 0.05) than the CD45 laboratories, and so would be expected to have fewer problems with the assay. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories which choose to use a single CD3/CD4/CD8 tube for immunophenotyping may be sacrificing both accuracy and reproducibility.",

Even when such responses are detected, they do not usually result in spontaneous remission of the cancer. We hypothesized that this might be associated with a predominant phenotype and/or cytokine profile of tumor-specific responses that is different from protective T cell responses to other chronic Ags, such as CMV. We detected significant T cell responses to CEA, HER-2/neu, and/or MAGE-A3 in 17 of 21 breast cancer patients naive to immunotherapy. The pattern of T cell cytokines produced in response to tumor-associated Ags (TAAs) in breast cancer patients was significantly different from that produced in response to CMV or influenza in the same patients. Specifically, there was a higher proportion of IL-2-producing CD8(+) T cells, and a lower proportion of IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) and/or CD8(+) T cells responding to TAAs compared with CMV or influenza Ags. Finally, the phenotype of TAA-responsive CD8(+) T cells in breast cancer patients was almost completely CD28(+)CD45RA(-) (memory phenotype). CMV-responsive CD8(+) T cells in the same patients were broadly distributed among phenotypes, and contained a high proportion of terminal effector cells (CD27(-)CD28(-)CD45RA(+)) that were absent in the TAA responses. Taken together, these results suggest that TAA-responsive T cells are induced in breast cancer patients, but those T cells are phenotypically and functionally different from CMV- or influenza-responsive T cells. Immunotherapies directed against TAAs may need to alter these T cell signatures to be effective.",

        abstract = "BACKGROUND: The effective and accurate diagnosis of hematologic malignancies relies on flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Selected combinations of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) arranged in multicolor panels allow for the accurate definition of normal and abnormal hematologic cell populations. The most time-consuming and crucial step in the staining process involves dispensing combinations of multiple mAbs into their appropriate staining tubes. This step is prone to error, requires concentration and accuracy, and is dependent on technologist experience.The Becton Dickinson BioScience (BD) FACS Sample Prep Assistant (SPA) is touted as a breakthrough in automated in vitro diagnostic sample preparation. The SPA is designed to automate BD MultiTESk and BD TriTest lyse/no-wash assays. However, because most cases in our laboratory require tedious application of unique four-color mAb cocktails for leukemia and lymphoma testing, we wondered whether the SPA would be helpful in accurately dispensing these mixtures. METHODS: The mAb panels were prepared by the SPA in two separate timed runs and on separate days. Eleven specimens (nine from patients and two from normal volunteers) were split and stained with four-color cocktails created by the SPA or manually. The percentage of positive (%P) cells and mean fluorescent intensity for each mAb pair were determined. These values were plotted against each other and correlation values were calculated. To quantitate timesaving in the laboratory, two technologists prepared individually the same mAb panels and were timed. RESULTS: The correlation between the two methods was high; r(2) was 0.988 for 158 %P antigen pairs; no bias between the manual and robotic methods was detected with the Wilcoxon rank test. Bland-Altman analysis indicated no obvious relation between the difference and the mean of %P cells, suggesting that the SPA successfully dispensed antibodies for leukemia/lymphoma panels. The two methods may be interchangeable, although the limited sample size prohibits this conclusion from Bland-Altman statistics alone. In addition, one possible error was detected in the SPA-prepared panels. The SPA averaged 65 min/run, the experienced technologist 12.95 min/run, and the inexperienced technologist 54.9 min/run. CONCLUSIONS: SPA dispensing time was twice the average manual dispensing time; however, SPA use was completely automated and freed the technologist to perform other tasks. SPA use permitted preemptive preparation of mAb panels and thus streamlined processing; however, the cost of the assay and the amount of reagent waste increased. It is certain that software modifications by BD could decrease the SPA reagent dispense time and decrease the cost associated with reagent waste when the SPA is used in this novel fashion.",

Recent simulation studies consider only simple correlation structures among variables, which is hardly inspired by real data features. Our aim is to systematically study effects of several network features like sparsity and correlation strength by imposing dependence structures among variables using random correlation matrices. RESULTS: We study the robustness against dependence of several FDR procedures that are popular in microarray studies, such as Benjamin-Hochberg FDR, Storey's q-value, SAM and resampling based FDR procedures. False Non-discovery Rates and estimates of the number of null hypotheses are computed from those methods and compared. Our simulation study shows that methods such as SAM and the q-value do not adequately control the FDR to the level claimed under dependence conditions. On the other hand, the adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg procedure seems to be most robust while remaining conservative. Finally, the estimates of the number of true null hypotheses under various dependence conditions are variable. CONCLUSION: We discuss a new method for efficient guided simulation of dependent data, which satisfy imposed network constraints as conditional independence structures. Our simulation set-up allows for a structural study of the effect of dependencies on multiple testing criterions and is useful for testing a potentially new method on pi0 or FDR estimation in a dependency context.",

Two equations were derived, one for the maximal basal (B-max) and the other for the maximal i.v. glucagon stimulated peak C-peptide (P-max) levels reached during the remission period. The prognostic variables selected for analysis were: peak C-peptide levels at diagnosis (Po), age sex, degree of obesity, pubertal rating, the presence of islet cell antibodies (ICA) and levels of GHb. Multivariate analysis of the data showed that Po (p = 0.0006), puberty (p = 0.041). obesity (p = 0.0021), sex (p = 0.031), ICA (p = 0.0045) and GHb(p = 0.0066) significantly contributed to the prediction formula obtained for B-max whereas the contribution of the above variables for P-max were: Po (p = 0.0019), puberty (p = 0.0187), obesity (p = 0.0058), sex (p = 0.0598), ICA (p = 0.0187) and GHb (p = 0.0027). The residuals of the observed values from the values fitted by the predicted equations served to define two separate groups demonstrating distinct differences in the natural course of beta cell function in type I diabetes. This fitted model may thus be useful in distinguishing between newly diagnosed young patients who will undergo remission, requiring lower insulin doses, and those who have little chance for remission. It might also be helpful in the selection of patients most likely to benefit from immunosuppression or modulation, to maximize the benefit to risk ratio for such patients.",

Blast cells were first identified by CD45/SSC gating in 74 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the results were compared to a conventional FSC/SSC gating procedure and to MGG-staining smears. The percentages of blast cells in these samples as defined by the morphological analysis of MGG smears correlated better with the values determined by CD45/SSC gating (r = 0.94) than with the blast cell counts recorded with FSC/SSC gating (r = 0.76). These findings were not surprising because while CD45 expression was regularly lower on leukemic blasts than on normal lymphoid and monocytic cells, the FCS/SSC characteristics of these populations were overlapping. In 53 samples, the blast cell populations were also analyzed with a panel of FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies that were utilized in double labeling with CD45-PE. We show that the CD45/SSC gating procedure improved phenotypic determination of the blast cells in three ways: (1) by discriminating between leukemic blast cells and residual normal cells; (2) by excluding normal cells from the phenotypic analysis of leukemic blast cells; and (3) by identifying blast cell heterogeneity in many cases of leukemia on the basis of different CD45 display. Moreover, this immunophenotyping procedure on whole bone marrow samples also allowed an efficient discrimination between the various cell lineages and facilitated the analysis of leukemic blasts present in low proportions.",

However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box-Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis.",

AIM: Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of CD45 expression in the immunological classification of BCLPDs. SETTING AND DESIGN: A prospective study was set in a university hospital to investigate the CD45 intensity, particularly in B-CLL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of CD45 in 37 patients with BCLPD including typical B-CLL (Group I), atypical B-CLL and CLL/PLL (II), and hairy cell leukemia (HCL), B-prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), and B-non Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) as non-CLL BCLPDs (III) and in eight healthy age matched controls (IV) was quantitatively compared by flow cytometric CD45/RALS gating strategy. Statistical analysis: The mean, median, and peak channel scores of CD45 obtained for the four groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance test. A P value RESULTS: Lower CD45 density is associated highly with typical CLL and differences between typical CLL and other groups were significant (P< 0.001, 0.001, and 0.001). Non-CLL cases had significantly brighter CD45 expression than atypical CLL (P=0.014). No differences were found between normal lymphocytes and non-CLL BCLPD cases. CONCLUSIONS: CD45 is a useful marker, to discriminate the typical CLL from the non-CLL BCLPD and from atypical CLL.",

This restricts the type of features that can be extracted (typically pulse height, width, and integral) and consequently places a limit on classification performance. In previous work, we described a first-generation digital data acquisition and processing system that was used to demonstrate the classification advantages provided by the extraction of additional waveform features. An improved version of the system is discussed in this paper, focusing on dual-buffering to ensure increased pulse capture. A mathematical model of the system is also presented for performance analysis. METHODS: The second-generation system incorporates fast digitization of analog pulse waveforms, instantaneous pulse detection hardware, and a novel dual-buffering scheme. A mathematical model of the system was developed to theoretically compute the capture-rate performance. RESULTS: The capture rate of the system was theoretically analyzed and empirically measured. Under typical conditions, a capture rate of 8,000 pulses/s was experimentally achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, the dual-buffer architecture shows great potential for use in flow cytometry.",

These histograms have traditionally been plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. However, the recent trend of performing the logarithmic conversion in software has made apparent some limitations of the traditional visual presentation of logarithmic data. This review discusses the mathematics of presenting data on a histogram and emphasizes the difference between scaling and binning. The review introduces the concept of an effective resolution to describe how the bin width changes in a variable bin-width histogram. The change in effective resolution is used to explain the commonly observed valley and picket fencing artifacts. These result from the effective resolution of the display histogram being too high for the data being presented. Recently, several different binning transformations have been described that are becoming more popular because they allow one to view a large dynamic range of data on a single plot, while allowing the display of negative data values. While each of the transforms is based upon different equations, they all exhibit very similar properties. All of the transforms bin the data logarithmically at high channel values and linearly at low channel values. The linear scaling of the lower channels serves to limit the effective resolution of the histogram, thus minimizing the valley and picket fencing artifacts. The newer transformations are not without their own limitations and recommendations for the appropriate manner of presenting flow cytometry data using these newer transformations are discussed.",

After fluorescence compensation, some cell populations will have low means and include events with negative data values. Logarithmic presentation has been very useful in providing informative displays of wide-ranging flow cytometry data, but it fails to adequately display cell populations with low means and high variances and, in particular, offers no way to include negative data values. This has led to a great deal of difficulty in interpreting and understanding flow cytometry data, has often resulted in incorrect delineation of cell populations, and has led many people to question the correctness of compensation computations that were, in fact, correct. RESULTS: We identified a set of criteria for creating data visualization methods that accommodate the scaling difficulties presented by flow cytometry data. On the basis of these, we developed a new data visualization method that provides important advantages over linear or logarithmic scaling for display of flow cytometry data, a scaling we refer to as \quote{Logicle} scaling. Logicle functions represent a particular generalization of the hyperbolic sine function with one more adjustable parameter than linear or logarithmic functions. Finally, we developed methods for objectively and automatically selecting an appropriate value for this parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The Logicle display method provides more complete, appropriate, and readily interpretable representations of data that includes populations with low-to-zero means, including distributions resulting from fluorescence compensation procedures, than can be produced using either logarithmic or linear displays. The method includes a specific algorithm for evaluating actual data distributions and deriving parameters of the Logicle scaling function appropriate for optimal display of that data. It is critical to note that Logicle visualization does not change the data values or the descriptive statistics computed from them.",

        abstract = "BACKGROUND: In multivariate distributions (for example, in 3- or more color flow cytometric datasets), it can become difficult or impossible to identify populations that differ between samples based only on a combination of univariate or bivariate displays. Indeed, it is possible that such differences can only be identified in \quote{n}-dimensional space, where \quote{n} is the number of parameters measured. Therefore, computer assisted identification of such differences is necessary. Such a method could be used to identify responses (i.e., by comparing cell samples before and after stimulation) in exquisite detail by allowing complete analysis of the collected data on only those events which have responded. METHODS: Multivariate Probability Binning can be used to compare different datasets to identify the distance and statistical significance of a difference between the distributions. An intermediate step in the algorithm provides access to the actual locations within the n-dimensional comparison which are most different between the distributions. Gates based on collections of hyper-rectangular bins can then be applied to datasets, thereby selecting those events (or clusters of events) that are different between samples. We term this process Frequency Difference Gating. RESULTS: Frequency Difference Gating was used in several test scenarios to evaluate its utility. First, we compared PBMC subsets identified by solely by immunofluorescence staining: based on this training data set, the algorithm automatically generated an accurate forward and side-scatter gate to identify lymphocytes. Second, we applied the algorithm to identify subtle differences between CD4 memory subsets based on 8-color immunophenotyping data. The resulting 3-dimensional gate could resolve cells subsets much more frequent in one subset compared to the other; no combination of two-dimensional gates could accomplish this resolution. Finally, we used the algorithm to compare B cell populations derived from mice of different ages or strains, and found that the algorithm could find very subtle differences between the populations. CONCLUSION: Frequency Difference Gating is a powerful tool that automates the process of identifying events comprising underlying differences between samples. It is not a clustering tool; it is not meant to identify subsets in multidimensional space. Importantly, this method may reveal subtle changes in small populations of cells, changes that only occur simultaneously in multiple dimensions in such a way that identification by univariate or bivariate analyses is impossible. Finally, the method may significantly aid in the analysis of high-order multivariate data (i.e., 6-12 color flow cytometric analyses), where identification of differences between datasets becomes so time-consuming as to be impractical.

        abstract = "BACKGROUND: While several algorithms for the comparison of univariate distributions arising from flow cytometric analyses have been developed and studied for many years, algorithms for comparing multivariate distributions remain elusive. Such algorithms could be useful for comparing differences between samples based on several independent measurements, rather than differences based on any single measurement. It is conceivable that distributions could be completely distinct in multivariate space, but unresolvable in any combination of univariate histograms. Multivariate comparisons could also be useful for providing feedback about instrument stability, when only subtle changes in measurements are occurring. METHODS: We apply a variant of Probability Binning, described in the accompanying article, to multidimensional data. In this approach, hyper-rectangles of n dimensions (where n is the number of measurements being compared) comprise the bins used for the chi-squared statistic. These hyper-dimensional bins are constructed such that the control sample has the same number of events in each bin; the bins are then applied to the test samples for chi-squared calculations. RESULTS: Using a Monte-Carlo simulation, we determined the distribution of chi-squared values obtained by comparing sets of events from the same distribution; this distribution of chi-squared values was identical as for the univariate algorithm. Hence, the same formulae can be used to construct a metric, analogous to a t-score, that estimates the probability with which distributions are distinct. As for univariate comparisons, this metric scales with the difference between two distributions, and can be used to rank samples according to similarity to a control. We apply the algorithm to multivariate immunophenotyping data, and demonstrate that it can be used to discriminate distinct samples and to rank samples according to a biologically-meaningful difference. CONCLUSION: Probability binning, as shown here, provides a useful metric for determining the probability with which two or more multivariate distributions represent distinct sets of data. The metric can be used to identify the similarity or dissimilarity of samples. Finally, as demonstrated in the accompanying paper, the algorithm can be used to gate on events in one sample that are different from a control sample, even if those events cannot be distinguished on the basis of any combination of univariate or bivariate displays.

For example, determining whether two samples (e.g., a control and test sample) are statistically significantly different is useful to detect a response, or to provide feedback regarding instrument stability by detecting when collected data varies significantly over time. METHODS: We apply a variant of the chi-squared statistic to comparing univariate distributions. In this variant, a control distribution is divided such that an equal number of events fall into each of the divisions, or bins. This approach is thereby a mini-max algorithm, in that it minimizes the maximum expected variance for the control distribution. The control-derived bins are then applied to test sample distributions, and a normalized chi-squared value is computed. We term this algorithm Probability Binning. RESULTS: Using a Monte-Carlo simulation, we determined the distribution of chi-squared values obtained by comparing sets of events derived from the same distribution. Based on this distribution, we derive a conversion of any given chi-squared value into a metric that is analogous to a t-score, i.e., it can be used to estimate the probability that a test distribution is different from a control distribution. We demonstrate that this metric scales with the difference between two distributions, and can be used to rank samples according to similarity to a control. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this metric to ranking immunophenotyping distributions to suggest that it indeed can be used to objectively determine the relative distance of distributions compared to a single control. CONCLUSION: Probability Binning, as shown here, provides a useful metric for determining the probability that two or more flow cytometric data distributions are different. This metric can also be used to rank distributions to identify which are most similar or dissimilar. In addition, the algorithm can be used to quantitate contamination of even highly-overlapping populations.

Concomitant advances in scalable computational algorithms are necessary to better utilize the information that is contained in these high-complexity experiments. The development of such tools has the potential to expand the utility of flow cytometric analysis from a predominantly hypothesis-driven mode to one of discovery, or hypothesis-generating research. A new method of analysis of flow cytometric data called Cytometric Fingerprinting (CF) has been developed. CF captures the set of multivariate probability distribution functions corresponding to list-mode data and then \quote{flattens} them into a computationally efficient fingerprint representation that facilitates quantitative comparisons of samples. An experimental and synthetic data were generated to act as reference sets for evaluating CF. Without the introduction of prior knowledge, CF was able to \quote{discover} the location and concentration of spiked cells in ungated analyses over a concentration range covering four orders of magnitude, to a lower limit on the order of 10 spiked events in a background of 100,000 events. We describe a new method for quantitative analysis of list-mode cytometric data. CF includes a novel algorithm for space subdivision that improves estimation of the probability density function by dividing space into nonrectangular polytopes. Additionally it renders a multidimensional distribution in the form of a one-dimensional multiresolution hierarchical fingerprint that creates a computationally efficient representation of high dimensionality distribution functions. CF supports both the generation and testing of hypotheses, eliminates sources of operator bias, and provides an increased level of automation of data analysis.",

        abstract = "Improved leukemia classification and tailoring of therapy have greatly improved patient outcome particularly for children with acute leukemia (AL). Using immunophenotyping, molecular genetics and cytogenetics the low hanging fruits of biomedical research have been successfully incorporated in routine diagnosis of leukemia subclasses. Future improvements in the classification and understanding of leukemia biology will very likely be more slow and laborious. Recently, gene expression profiling has provided a framework for the global molecular analysis of hematological cancers, and high throughput proteomic analysis of leukemia samples is on the way. Here we consider classification of acute leukemia samples by flow cytometry using the marker proteins of immunophenotyping as a component of the proteome. Marker protein expressions are converted into quantitative expression values and subjected to computational analysis. Quantitative multivariate analysis from panels of marker proteins has demonstrated that marker protein expression profiles can distinguish MLLre from non-MLLre ALL cases and also allow to specifically distinguish MLL/AF4 cases. Potentially, these quantitative expression analyses can be used in clinical diagnosis. Immunophenotypic data collection using flow cytometry is a fast and relatively easily accessible technology that has already been implemented in most centers for leukemia diagnosis and the translation into quantitative expression data sets is a matter of flow cytometer settings and output calibration. However, before application in clinical diagnostics can occur it is crucial that quantitative immunophenotypic data set analysis is validated in independent experiments and in large data sets.",

        abstract = "BACKGROUND: Identification of minor cell populations, e.g. leukemic blasts within blood samples, has become increasingly important in therapeutic disease monitoring. Modern flow cytometers enable researchers to reliably measure six and more variables, describing cellular size, granularity and expression of cell-surface and intracellular proteins, for thousands of cells per second. Currently, analysis of cytometry readouts relies on visual inspection and manual gating of one- or two-dimensional projections of the data. This procedure, however, is labor-intensive and misses potential characteristic patterns in higher dimensions. RESULTS: Leukemic samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at initial diagnosis and during induction therapy have been investigated by 4-color flow cytometry. We have utilized multivariate classification techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM), to automate leukemic cell detection in cytometry. Classifiers were built on conventionally diagnosed training data. We assessed the detection accuracy on independent test data and analyzed marker expression of incongruently classified cells. SVM classification can recover manually gated leukemic cells with 99.78% sensitivity and 98.87% specificity. CONCLUSION: Multivariate classification techniques allow for automating cell population detection in cytometry readouts for diagnostic purposes. They potentially reduce time, costs and arbitrariness associated with these procedures. Due to their multivariate classification rules, they also allow for the reliable detection of small cell populations.",

With the advances in FACS methodology, notably intracellular staining for cytokines, transcription factors and phosphoproteins, and with increases in the number of fluorescence detection channels, researchers now have the opportunity to study individual cells in far greater detail than previously possible. In this chapter, we discuss High-Definition (Hi-D) FACS methods that can improve analysis of lymphocyte subsets in mouse and man. We focus on the reasons why fluorescence compensation, which is necessary to correct for spectral overlap between two or more fluorochromes used in the same staining combination, is best done as a computed transformation rather than using the analog circuitry available on many flow cytometers. In addition, we introduce a new data visualization method that scales the axes on histograms and two-dimensional contour (or dot) plots to enable visualization of signals from all cells, including those that have minimal fluorescence values and are not properly represented with traditional logarithmic axes. This \quote{Logicle} visualization method, we show, provides superior representations of compensated data and makes correctly compensated data look correct. Finally, we discuss controls that facilitate recognition of boundaries between positive and negative subsets.",

In addition, differential molecular cell phenotypes between diseased and healthy cells provide molecular data patterns for (i) predictive medicine by cytomics or for (ii) drug discovery purposes using reverse engineering of the data patterns by biomedical cell systems biology. Molecular pathways can be explored in this way including the detection of suitable target molecules, without detailed a priori knowledge of specific disease mechanisms. This is useful during the analysis of complex diseases such as infections, allergies, rheumatoid diseases, diabetes or malignancies. The top-down approach reaching from single cell heterogeneity in cell systems and tissues down to the molecular level seems suitable for a human cytome project to systematically explore the molecular biocomplexity of human organisms. The analysis of already existing data from scientific studies or routine diagnostic procedures will be of immediate value in clinical medicine, for example as personalized therapy by cytomics.",

Flow cytometry has the capacity to acquire multi-parameter information of large haematopoietic cell populations, utilizing various combinations of >200 molecular markers (clusters of differentiation, CD). However, current flow cytometry analyses are based on serial gating of two-parametric scatter plots--a process that is inherently incapable to discriminate all subgroups of cells in the data. Here we studied the cellular diversity of normal bone marrows (BM) using multi-dimensional cluster analysis of six-parametric flow cytometry data (four CD, forward scatter and side scatter), focusing mainly on the myeloid lineage. Twenty-three subclasses of cells were resolved, many of them inseparable even when examined in all possible two-parametric scatter plots. The multi-dimensional analysis could distinguish the haematopoietic progenitors according to International Society of Haematotherapy and Graft Engineering criteria from other types of immature cells. Based on the defined clusters, we designed a classifier that assigns BM cells in samples to subclasses based on robust six-dimensional position and extended shape. The analysis presented here can manage successfully both the increasing numbers of haematopoietic cellular markers and sample heterogeneity. This should enhance the ability to study normal haematopoiesis, and to identify and monitor haematopoietic disorders.",
